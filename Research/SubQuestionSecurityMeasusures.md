# What security measures will be put in place to protect user privacy and data security?

## SWOT-analysis

### Kafka <sup>1,2</sup>

**Strengths**:

- Scalability and Fault Tolerance: Kafka is highly scalable and fault-tolerant, which makes it a reliable platform for data streaming.
- High Throughput: Kafka can manage real-time data streams efficiently, offering high throughput.

**Weaknesses:**

- Complexity: Kafka’s distributed environment can be complex to manage and secure.
- Integration with Other Components: Integration with other components exposes Kafka to more security threats.

**Opportunities**:

- Authentication: Authentication verifies the identity of users and applications connecting to Kafka. Kafka brokers and Confluent Servers authenticate connections from clients and other brokers using Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) or mutual TLS (mTLS).
- Authorization: Authorization allows you to define the actions users and applications are allowed to take once connected.
- Encryption: Protecting data in transit and at rest, using SSL/TLS for secure communication.

**Threats:**

- Unauthorized Access: If proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are not implemented, an attacker might gain unauthorized access to a Kafka topic holding sensitive data.
- Data Breach: This could lead to a data breach and potential legal and financial liabilities.
- Network Security: Kafka clusters should be secured with network-level security measures such as firewalls, network segmentation, and the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to prevent unauthorized access from external networks.

### Next.js <sup>3,4</sup>

**Strengths:**

- Efficiency: Next.js is efficient and easy to use, with automatic server rendering and code splitting.
- Versatility: It supports both server-side rendering and static site generation.

## Multi-criteria analysis

I will look at what the earlier methods brought for tasks that can be implemented into the project. I will make a table on how much time it could possibly take to implement, then what problems and solutions it brings to the project, Is it possible to do in the current semester, how important is it, and we finish off with how difficult it’s to maintain.

Possible-to-do is based around what can a group of students possibly do in around 20 weeks. It also needs to be done reasonably well.

Importance is from High to low. Where High means it will affect security higher if implemented. This is opinionated to a degree.

Maintainability is from High to low. Where High means there needs to be frequent changes and needs to be worked on when things are changed. This is opinionated to a degree.

## Guideline conformity analysis

### Kafka <sup>1, 17, 18</sup>

- Network Security: This ensures restricted access through firewalls, network segmentation, and VPNs.
- Authentication and Authorization: These mechanisms like SSL certificates or SASL ensure only authorized clients access the cluster. Kafka has relatively little security enabled out of the box, so you need a basic familiarity with authentication, authorization, encryption, and audit logs in Kafka in order to securely put your system into production.
- Encryption: This encrypts data in transit and at rest, using SSL/TLS for secure communication. All operations should be recorded in an audit log so that there is an audit trail in case something happens, or the behavior of the cluster needs to be verified.
- Best Practices for Security in Kafka:
  - Authenticate Everything.
  - Encrypt Everything.
  - Update Regularly.
  - Enable and Configure Access Control Lists.
  - Secure cluster configuration.
  - Implement monitoring and auditing.
  - Ensure network segmentation.
  - Staying updated with security measures.

### Next.js <sup>3, 15, 16</sup>

- Choosing Your Data Handling Model: React Server Components blur the line between server and client. Data handling is paramount in understanding where information is processed and subsequently made available. The first thing we need to do is pick what data handling approach is appropriate for our project. There are three main approaches:
  - HTTP APIs: Recommended for existing large projects / orgs.
  - Data Access Layer: Recommended for new projects.
  - Component Level Data Access: Recommended for prototyping and learning.
- Authentication: Authentication verifies if the user is who they say they are. It requires the user to prove their identity with something they have, such as a username and password. Modern web applications commonly use several authentication strategies:
  - OAuth/OpenID Connect (OIDC)
  - Credentials-based login (Email + Password)
  - Passwordless/Token-based authentication
  - Passkeys/WebAuthn
- Content Security Policy (CSP): CSP is important to guard your Next.js application against various security threats such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other code injection attacks.
- Best Practices for Security in Next.js:
  - Keep dependencies up to date.
  - Use proper input validation.
  - Set up authentication and authorization.
  - Encrypt sensitive data.
  - Implement security headers.
  - Use TypeScript for type safety.
  - Write maintainable tests.

### Python

#### Regular Python <sup>5, 19, 20, 21</sup>

----

- Sanitize Inputs: Python is just as vulnerable to injection attacks as any other language. Always sanitize data from external sources, whether the data originates from a user input form, scraping a website, or a database request.
- Avoid Dangerous Functions: You can usually avoid the risk of code injections by not running user input as commands or script.
- Eliminate Implicit Relative Imports: If you are still using Python, a major risk comes from using implicit relative imports.
- Scan Your Code: Regularly scan your code for vulnerabilities.
- Update Your Versions: Keeping the Python version up to date is an essential practice for developing secure Python applications.

#### Flask <sup>22, 23, 24, 25</sup>

----

- Flask-Security: Flask-Security allows you to quickly add common security mechanisms to your Flask application. They include:
  - Session based authentication.
  - Role and Permission management.
  - Password hashing.
  - Basic HTTP authentication.
  - Token based authentication.
  - Token based account activation (optional).
  - Token based password recovery / resetting (optional).
- Security Headers: Enforce those HTTP headers and validate Origin and Referer headers to protect against CSRF and XSS.
- Session Management: Manage sessions with Flask-Session, move that session data to the server-side.
- Protect Sensitive Data: Keep sensitive data on lockdown by using environment variables for configuration, following recommendations from the security experts.
- Security Considerations: Flask provides a list of security considerations that every developer should follow. They include:
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - JSON Security
  - Security Headers
